# Social Media Back End
By Jake Smith

## Project Description
This application is the entire back end of a social media website. Through the use of an API development platform such as Insomnia or Postman, a user can create a user profile by
providing their email and username. Once registered, the user can make posts (called "Thoughts" in the application's code), friend other users, and react to other user's Thoughts with
reactions. Users can also delete their Thoughts, Reactions, and their own profile as well.

## Technologies Utilized
This application heavily leverages MongoDB and Mongoose in order to create API routes for information to pass through. It utilizes the CLI to launch the server through the command,
"node server". Express is used to initialize the server, and uses node.js as well. CRUD operations expressed in Javascript are used as well.
